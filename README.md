# IIR Vowel Formant Filter

This C++ Vowel Formant Filter consists of a series of IIR filters in different configurations for testing effective formant synthesis using the source/model theory.  The plugin has filter presets for the 5 basic vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in 3 octaves (bass, tenor, and alto).  The formant filters can be placed in either cascade or parallel and the number of active formants can altered from 0 to 5 filters.  The code is meant to accompany my paper [Proposal for Research, Design, and Evaluation of a Formant Filter](https://sway.office.com/6rPoUHP4RIM2MkBz?ref=Link).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

You can download RackAFX 

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
